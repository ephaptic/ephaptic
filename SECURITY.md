# Security Policy

Ephaptic is designed to be the backbone of secure applications. As such, we take security vulnerabilities very seriously.

## Supported Versions

Since Ephaptic is in active development, we generally only backport security fixes to the latest minor version.

However, luckily, Ephaptic is almost always backwards compatible, so it's safe to frequently update to the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a vulnerability under the security tab. For more info, [read this article](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
